### Functional Requirements

1. **Script**:
   - The backend is developed using **Python** with **Flask** to handle the API logic.
   - The frontend uses **React** and **Chakra UI** for the user interface and responsiveness.
   - The system supports CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for managing friends in a database.
   - The application supports **light and dark modes**, along with a **responsive design** for various screen sizes.

2. **List of Requirements**:
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite for the backend; React and Chakra UI for the frontend.
   - **CRUD Functionality**: The system must support creating, reading, updating, and deleting friends from the database.
   - **User Interface**: A dynamic, styled UI with options for light and dark themes.
   - **Responsive Design**: The UI should adapt to various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

3. **UI Plan**:
   - **Stylish UI components**: Leverage Chakra UI for providing modern UI components.
   - **Light and Dark Modes**: Users should be able to toggle between light and dark themes.
   - **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the layout adjusts seamlessly across different device screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

4. **How the System Should Be**:
   - The system should function as a full-stack web application, providing API endpoints for friend management.
   - The backend must use best practices like **virtual environments** to ensure an isolated development environment.
   - The frontend should offer a clean, visually appealing interface that allows users to interact with friends' data easily.

5. **Goal**:
   - To build and deploy a fully functional friend management application that demonstrates a complete understanding of full-stack development using **Python (Flask)** and **React**.
   - Deploy the application on **Render** or a similar platform for public access.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The application is deployed on a free tier (Render), so it must be optimized for lower resource usage.
   - The tech stack choices (SQLite, SQLAlchemy) imply limits on database scalability, suitable for smaller projects.
   - Dependencies and deployment must be managed efficiently through **virtual environments**.

7. **Reports**:
   - Reports or logs on CRUD operations (e.g., creation and deletion of friends) should be accessible for debugging or tracking purposes.
   - Any errors or issues during deployment or CRUD functionality should be logged and handled gracefully by the system.
